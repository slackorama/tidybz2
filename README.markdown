TidyBz2
=======

A Greasemonkey script to (hopefully) improve the interface to instances of
Bugzilla still running version 2.  It also adds some keyboard shortcuts.

Usage
-----

First, you'll need to install
[Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748 ).

Then, after restarting your browser, you'll need to download the [tidybz2.user.js](http://github.com/slackorama/tidybz2/raw/master/tidybz2.user.js) script for it to install.

It probably goes without saying but this script won't run on anything but
Firefox (and maybe Chrome).

Once you have it up and running, just press `?` to get a list of keyboard shortcuts.

Acknowledgments
----------------

Thanks to Jesse Ruderman for the inspiration via
[TidyBug](http://www.squarefree.com/2009/02/26/tidybug/) and JPDaigle for the
keyboard navigation via
[BugzillaKeyboardNavigation](http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/42342).

TODO
----

Fix up the keyboard shortcut display.  It's using a lowly gitJavaScript alert
right now and it's getting a bit cramped.
